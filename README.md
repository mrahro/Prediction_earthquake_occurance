Kaggle LANL Earthquake Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction

This project includes:
- Preprocessing of the the input data to get insight of the acoustic pulses.
- adding various statistical features to the initial single featured data.
- removing uncorrelated features to reduce computational cost and wrong predicitons.
- trying multiple models and evalauting the models.
- combining a few models and making predictions and finally the submission files.
